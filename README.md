# TrackRx Application 
# Jordan Hanson, Garrett Howard, Tyler Cain


# Description of Project:
This application will provide a simple user interface (that will require log-in credentials for security purposes) that will allow a user to:
*Input which medications they are currently utilizing
*Their medication dosage (e.g. in milligrams)
*View a medication dashboard private to their user credentials, and 
*View nearby pharmacies based on their current location

These details will be consolidated in a straightforward dashboard view. 

# Use Case:
This application would be designed to alleviate the stress of individuals who have to take multiple medications simultaneously or at different intervals throughout the day. This could potentially help people with autoimmune, chronic, or congenital health conditions, as well as people suffering from comorbidities (e.g. heart disease and diabetes, or anxiety and depression). 

# API Used:
Google Maps API 
Will collect the userâ€™s current location and display nearby pharmacies
