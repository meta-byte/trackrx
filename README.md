# TrackRx Application 
# Jordan Hansen, Garrett Howard, Tyler Cain



# Description of Project:
This application will provide a simple user interface (that will require log-in credentials for security purposes) that will allow a user to:
*Input which medications they are currently utilizing
*Their medication dosage (e.g. in milligrams)
*The number of times per day they should consume the medication(s), and 
*View nearby pharmacies based on their current location

These details will be consolidated in a straightforward dashboard view. There will be embedded functions that will calculate when a patient/user needs to take their medication based on previously inputted and saved information and alert them upon log-in to verify they have taken the proper dosage and permutation of medications.

# Use Case:
This application would be designed to alleviate the stress of individuals who have to take multiple medications simultaneously or at different intervals throughout the day. This could potentially help people with autoimmune, chronic, or congenital health conditions, as well as people suffering from comorbidities (e.g. heart disease and diabetes, or anxiety and depression). 

# API Used:
Google Maps API 
Will collect the userâ€™s current location and display nearby pharmacies

GoodRX API
Will autocomplete/suggest medication names upon initial user entry
